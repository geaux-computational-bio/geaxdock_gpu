GeauxDock is an ultra-fast automated docking program, designed to predict
how small ligands bind to pharmacologically relevant macromolecules.

GeauxDock employs a novel hybrid force field and a Monte Carlo protocol for 
the efficient sampling of conformational space.

The codes have been tuned for NVidia Fermi and Kepler generation graphics 
processing units (GPUs).

GeauxDock has applications in:
1. ligand virtual screening
2. structure-based drug design
3. drug repositioning and polypharmacology

Step-by-step setup and operating instructions can be found in 
doc/instructions.txt.

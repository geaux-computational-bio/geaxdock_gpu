=== Description
GeauxDock is an ultra-fast automated docking program, designed to predict
how small ligands bind to pharmacologically relevant macromolecules.

GeauxDock  employs a novel hybrid force field and a Monte Carlo protocol for 
the efficient sampling of conformational space.

The codes have been tuned for NVidia Fermi- and Kepler-Generation Graphics 
processing unit(GPU).

GeauxDock has applications in:
1. ligand virtual screening
2. structure-based drug design
3. drug repositioning and polypharmacology


=== Purpose
The purpose of molecular docking is to predict the preferred orientation of 
small ligands within the binding sites of pharmacologically relevant 
macromolecules as well as to reliably estimate the associated strength of 
binding. GeauxDock simulates small molecule binding to proteins expanding the 
repertoire of tools for computer-aided structure-based drug discovery.

=== Specifications 
Compared to other ligand docking programs, GeauxDock offers several unique 
features:

1. A mixed-resolution of protein-ligand complexes. Ligands are treated at the 
atomic level, whereas proteins are coarse-grained representing individual 
residues by sets of effective points: the backbone alpha carbon, the geometric 
center of a peptide plate, and either one or two effective points representing 
the side chain (depending on the size).

2. A high tolerance to target structure deformations. As a consequence of the 
mixed-resolution, GeauxDock is fairly insensitive to distortions in protein 
structures. Thus, experimental structures in their apo conformational states as 
well as various quality protein models can be used as targets for small 
molecule docking.

3. A combined evolution/physics-based force field. The energy function 
implemented in GeauxDock integrates evolution- and physics-based components. 
The relative contribution of these terms depends on the amount of evolutionary 
information extracted from homologous complexes. In the absence of homologues, 
weaker evolutionary-derived restraints are compensated by the stronger 
contribution of physics-based energy terms.The capability of the force field to 
reproduce experimental ligand binding poses and the corresponding binding 
affinities was tested on the Astex/CCDC and BindingDB datasets of 
pharmacologically relevant protein-ligand complexes.

4. Monte Carlo sampling scheme. GeauxDock uses the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo 
algorithm to efficiently explore the conformational space of protein-ligand 
interactions. This protocol was optimized to rapidly discover near-native 
ligand configurations.

4. Computations on graphics processing units (GPU). GeauxDock is implemented in 
CUDA-C. The code exploits the coarse-grained parallelisms for multiple 
replicas; specifically, replica simulations are dispatched on multiple CUDA 
thread blocks. The computation of molecular interactions utilizes the 
fine-grained parallelism using massive CUDA threads.


=== Prerequisites

GeauxDock has been tested on the following OS:

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 6.5
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.2

GeauxDock has been tested with the following packages:

 CUDA 5 and the NVidia binary GPU drivers
 gcc 4.4.6
 hdf5 1.8.10


=== Steps - Initial Setup and Simple Run

Follow these steps to setup and run the code the first time. The sample 
commands are for a user with home directory "/home/smith/“ and who has unpacked 
the GeauxDock distribution into a directory “dock/“, so that the path to the 
readme file would be “/home/smith/dock/README.txt”.

 [ ]  Install Prerequisites
      Review the list of prerequisites, and install what is
      needed. 


 [ ]  Set Location of CUDA and HDF5
      If your CUDA installation is in /usr/local/cuda (the
      default), and the HDF5 library is in /usr/local/lib,
      then edit src/Makefile, and change the assignment of
      LIBPATH so that it points to your CUDA and HDF5 installation.

      example:
      LIBPATH := -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 -L/usr/local/lib


 [ ]  Build the Code
      Commands:

      % cd /home/smith/dock/src/
      % make

      If the build is successful a executable named "dock" will be created
      in the src directory.  If not, find an experienced programmer
      to help identify and fix the problems.
 

 [ ]  Run The Code
      The command below will run GeauxDock using the provided parameter file.

      > cd /home/smith/dock/data

      > ../src/dock -id 1a07C1 -p ./1a07C1/1a07C.pdb -l ./1a07C1/1a07C1.sdf \
        -s ./1a07C1/1a07C1-0.8.ff -opt ./parameters/08ff_opt \
        -na ./parameters/08_nor_a -nb ./parameters/08_nor_b \
        -para ./parameters/paras -ns 2000 -nc 10 -floor_temp 0.044f \
        -ceiling_temp 0.036f -nt 1 -t 0.02f -r 0.08f

      The execution using the provided input and parameter file should complete
      in just a few seconds.

      A folder named with the time stamp "YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS" will be 
      created, under which you should see three output files: a_0000.h5,
      a_0001.h5 and a_0002.h5.  These files record the Monte Carlo steps 0-999, 
      1000-1999, and 2000-2999 respectively.


  [ ]  Results Verification
       In case of a successful simulation using the example input files,
       initial energy state as part of standard output should agree with the
       lines below:

       initial energy state
       ================================================================================
       rep step vdw ele pmf psp hdb hpc kde lhm dst total
       0 0 0.868 -0.032 -0.258 -0.057 0.905 -0.842 0.078 0.214 458.420 7.931

== Discussion of the code origin
GeauxDock was designed to use computer-generated protein models as targets for 
small molecule docking in structure-based drug discovery. The current 
high-performance implementation is based on a serial C++ version written by 
Michal Brylinski at Louisiana State University.
